# KiwiBankApi
Just to manipulate and download csv export file from bank account.

## The purpose :
This piece of code was part of a personal project where i needed to extract and download CSV export file from my bank account.

At the moment it is only capable of :
- login
- resolve the KeepSafe chalenge ( I don't understand why this is supposed to keep us safe...)
- return your Deposits & withdrawals in CSV format
- logout

Feel free to reuse and adapt to your needs.

## Warnings :
I am not responsible if you block your online bank account because of flooding...
